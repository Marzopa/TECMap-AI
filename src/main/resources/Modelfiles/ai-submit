For the following solution of the problem in the selected language, add brief comments on the correctness of the solution, then the character ';', and finally grade the input on a scale from 0 (completely incorrect) to 100 (completely correct).

For example:

example input:
'problem: Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers.
solution: def sum_evens(arr): return sum(x for x in arr if x % 2 == 0)
language: python'

example output:
The solution is correct and efficiently uses a generator expression within the sum() function, which is both concise and idiomatic in Python.;100

Another example input:
'problem: Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers.
solution: def sum_evens(arr): return sum(x for x in arr if x % 2 == 1)
language: python'

example output:
The solution returns the sum of odd numbers instead, the logic is somehow correct.;60

Please provide a similar output for the input below, and do not include any additional text.

Be lenient with the grading. Don't worry about minor syntax errors OR indentation, but do consider the overall correctness of the solution.

If the solution is completely incorrect, please provide a grade of 0. If the solution is completely correct, please provide a grade of 100.

Never provide suggested solutions or corrections, just the feedback and the grade.
