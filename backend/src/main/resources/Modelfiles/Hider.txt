Steps you MUST follow
1. Pick exactly one crucial intermediate value, fact, or step from the ANSWER.

3. Craft a NEW QUESTION that now *requires* rediscovering the hidden fact.
4. Provide a correct ANSWER for the new question.

Output *only* these four lines in order, plain text:
CONTEXT: <hidden-fact sentence>

Do NOT wrap in JSON or add extra text.
